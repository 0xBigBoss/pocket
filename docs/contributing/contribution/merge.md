Once all the issues are finalized, and the milestone integration branch is ready and tested, a PR has to be open against the `main` branch. You can follow this guide to create the PR,

- **From a fork:** [https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork)
- **From a branch:** [https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request)

On the PR, please include any details related to the job that you pushed. Proof of your local tests passing is a good practice, to help other developers know that the code is tested. Any screenshot or screencast is welcome to help others understand the impact of your work.

Be as detailed as you can, since this will help get a faster review of the PR. If the PR is not being reviewed, make sure to tag the issue creator from time to time, and even propose a review meeting to make this faster.

If the issue had extra deliverables, make sure to include them as part of your PR, to get the approvals.

Every PR should follow this template,

```jsx

## Review Phase

Wait for the commenter to acknowledge the answer or the fix of its comment.

- Commenter mask as resolved

## Actors Approvals

Ping the required actors on a PR comment to call their attention after this step has been fulfilled to ask for their final review. Take into consideration that these actors are busy and will ignore any PR that doesnâ€™t have the previous checks. Follow the actor's comments and provide feedback for the fix. make sure to mention them on any change related to their comments.

## Merge Blockers

- Milestone PRs will be selected for running the full Testing Regression and requires all test to be green before being merged.
- Milestone PRs will require to have all the comments reviewed and checked by both commenter and developer.
- Milestone PRs will require these approvals to unblock the merge,
    - 2 approvals from PNI Developers
- Milestone PRs should provide a working protocol, no pending work should be part of the milestone PR.

## Merge and Milestone Close

Once the PR has been reviewed, and all the PR blockers are green, go ahead and merge the PR to the `main` branch. After the PR is merged, make sure that the milestone is marked as closed and some comments related to the final result are included on the main milestone issue.
